# SQL-Data-Cleaning
 Cleaning and Preparing Data on Global Layoffs
 
 I recently worked on a project looking at job losses around the world, using data that shows layoffs in different industries and areas. This project was a good chance to show my SQL skills and improve my data cleaning and problem-solving skills.

Steps involved: 
✔ Importing Data: Data collected and loaded. 
✔ Cleaning the Data: Cleaning of data, such as removal of duplicates, standardization of formats, and handling of blank values. 
✔ Preparation: The dataset was prepared for analysis through fixing errors and inconsistencies.
 
 Different SQL functions were used in: 
✅ Window Functions: (ROW_NUMBER) 
✅ CTE: To make complex queries easier.
✅ Data Manipulation: UPDATE, DELETE & TRIM string functions to standardize text fields
✅ Alter with Modify: To fix the Datatype of columns
 
Key insights from the data cleaning process:
· Removed all duplicate records to ensure data accuracy and reliability.
· Standardized company names and locations, correcting spelling errors and
inconsistencies. 
· Removed records with blank values from critical fields, so that the dataset is complete for analysis.
· Corrected data types across the dataset, such as converting text to dates and integers, to facilitate accurate analysis.
